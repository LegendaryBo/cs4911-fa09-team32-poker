This project is part of course work for CS4911, Georgia Institute of Technology's senior design class.   The goal of this project is to create a C# application and class library for constructing psychological experiments involving playing cards.  The core application will consist of a graphical front-end that enables user interaction, a hand-evaluator that determines the 'nuts' of a given hand, machinery for tracking user interaction and experiment results, an experiment-builder component and a log viewer.
